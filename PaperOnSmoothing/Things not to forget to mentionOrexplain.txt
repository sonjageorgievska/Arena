Video vs wi-fi estimation : wi-fi works better for more congested scenarios
and works better in night events wehre the lights is dimmed (concerts,
festivals). I our case, the bigger the data , the more cancelation of errors
(because we are using the law of the large numbers) 

While we are at the law of large numbers, I should explain that even though our observations are not independent,
we can still use this laws. Namely, the observations are correlated: two MACS that are neighbours will tend to give similar fitted data. 
But in this case the variance of the sum tends to the average correlation as n approaches infinity. If the average correlation tends to 0 when n-> infinity(which it does, right?) then no problem here.

0. start why generally (crowd disasters from extreme density)
1. Start with why wi-fi (suplement to video analysis)
2. Start with fitted data and other papers that have used wi-fi
3. all the errors that come with it (e.g.bi-modal distribution due to interference and due to multiple local optima)
4. randomization
5. data is sparse (not every second) and interpolation would not work 

How we address  those challenges and how we validate our methodology
